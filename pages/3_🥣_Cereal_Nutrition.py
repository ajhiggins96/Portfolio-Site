        ## Project Summary

        The final product is a website comprised of five **interacive** data visualizations that use data from the USDA [National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/composition-foods-raw-processed-prepared-usda-national-nutrient-database-standard-reference-release-28-0).
        The visualizations try to meet the following user questions:
        1. How do the **macronutrients** of different cereal products compare?
        2. What kind of trade-off exists between **calories and sugar** in cereals?
        3. Which brands are a good source of different **micronutrients**?
        4. *How does cow's milk compare to **non-dairy alternatives**?
        5. How to **gluten-free alternatives** compare?
